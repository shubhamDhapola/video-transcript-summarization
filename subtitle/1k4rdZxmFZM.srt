This railway is at the heart of a

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,960
high stakes battle between the US and China

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,155
for economic influence in Africa. It's the Banguela

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,335
railway, part of the Lobito Atlantic Railway, which

5
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:13,335
connects Angola to the heart of the copper

6
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:16,230
belt in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,110
line is crucial for transporting minerals essential for

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,850
things like EV batteries and other green technologies

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,575
to the rest of the world. For years,

10
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:27,835
China has led Africa's infrastructure development, pouring 100

11
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:30,415
of 1,000,000,000 of dollars into projects like railways,

12
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:33,470
ports, and roads. But a successful US backed

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,550
bid to restore the rail line could change

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,745
power dynamics across the continent. The Banguela railway

15
00:00:42,745 --> 00:00:45,865
isn't new. It was built in 1902 and

16
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:48,580
has always been crucial to Angola's trade, but

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,140
it was severely damaged during the country's civil

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,980
war. If you do go on the rail

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,620
line, you can see, some blown up armored

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,345
vehicles. You can see railcars that have been

21
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:01,145
left to rust. After the war ended, Angola

22
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:03,945
needed to rebuild its infrastructure and China stepped

23
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:06,610
in to fill that need. So in 2006,

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,310
Angola agreed to a $2,000,000,000 deal with a

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,950
group of Chinese companies to rebuild the railway

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,745
line. But poor construction and upkeep led to

27
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:19,065
rundown stations, malfunctioning safety systems, offline servers, and

28
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:22,025
frequent derailments on the train line. There's something

29
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:25,560
like 10 derailments a year, which is extraordinary.

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,180
The stations weren't well built. There's all sorts

31
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,595
of technological equipment that just isn't working. And

32
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:34,075
so the entire rail line really needs a

33
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:36,955
a rebuild. But this time, Angola turned down

34
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:39,120
a proposal from the Chinese government to renovate

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,720
and manage the same neglected railway. Instead, it

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,805
awarded several European companies a 30 year contract,

37
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,445
which the United States government is likely to

38
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:53,090
finance with a $250,000,000 loan. The 1.7000000000 dollars

39
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,830
project will fix the train tracks and stations,

40
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,750
add over 1500 wagons and educate train operators.

41
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,035
It will also give countries involved in the

42
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:01,084
project, eager to advance their clean energy initiatives,

43
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:09,675
greater access to on Africa in Washington at

44
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,460
the moment is all about on Africa in

45
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,580
Washington at the moment is all about critical

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,640
and strategic minerals and, and security of supply.

47
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:20,105
Demand for these elements is expected to increase

48
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:22,985
by 20 fold from 2020 to 2040, which

49
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:25,145
has fueled interest in the Lobito Corridor and

50
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,480
to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world's

51
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,680
largest producer of cobalt. The project is expected

52
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,760
to be a key source of economic opportunity

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,665
for Angola's young population. So hope that they

54
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,905
will both feed the rest of the world

55
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,785
and also create jobs and opportunities inside of

56
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,865
Angola. Historically, you can see when you create

57
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:53,895
corridors, they attract people, especially infrastructure development. Launched

58
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:57,015
by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, its

59
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:59,515
goal is to boost China's global economic influence

60
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:03,120
through infrastructure, trade and investment deals. China loaned

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,620
African governments over $160,000,000,000 from 2,000 to 2022,

62
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,980
and Angola has received the most. The Chinese

63
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:17,885
in Angola provided roads, railways, football stadiums, suburbs

64
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:20,210
of of of of cities. But the initiative

65
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,850
has faced criticism from around the world over

66
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,310
poor construction, environmental impact, and long term economic

67
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,305
sustainability. And it's left some countries with significant

68
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,525
debts. Those are debts that are very hard

69
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:34,365
to pay back. In a response to the

70
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,620
journal, the Chinese government said that the Belt

71
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,340
and Road Initiative was not accountable for African

72
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,140
debt. In recent years, China's economy has taken

73
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,720
a turn and investments in Africa have plummeted.

74
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:48,895
Lending dipped below $1,000,000,000 in 2022, hitting a

75
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,095
nearly 2 decade low. China has been looking

76
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:56,120
at its debt exposure in Africa. It hasn't

77
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
had the sort of returns that it was

78
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,280
expecting, and so it's a lot more risk

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,105
averse in terms of its investment portfolio. This

80
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:06,265
lull gave the US an opportunity to step

81
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:08,985
in. But the US isn't just interested in

82
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:11,310
pushing back against China's influence in the region.

83
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,870
It also hopes to secure key resources for

84
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,310
future technological advancements. Copper in particular will prove

85
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,635
vital as the country transitions from old style

86
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:24,195
energy production. The Biden administration has put a

87
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:27,395
focus on strengthening commercial relations with Africa. In

88
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:29,635
2022, the government set out a plan for

89
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:32,260
a modern US Africa partnership and promised to

90
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,180
invest $55,000,000,000 in the continent. The United States

91
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,485
has been traditionally behind in, doing business in

92
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:42,325
Africa. And I think the the Biden administration

93
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,005
is hoping that will change and is trying

94
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,845
to help that change. And while it is

95
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:48,085
cautious of progress made by other countries in

96
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:51,500
the region. The Biden administration has really made

97
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,700
a point of saying to African countries, we

98
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,180
understand you have long standing relations with the

99
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,825
Chinese, with the Russians. We're not saying you

100
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:01,185
have to give that up. But here's what

101
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:02,785
we offer and we think you'll like it.

102
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:04,725
And the offers don't stop at the Lobito

103
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:07,600
Corridor project. The US is funding solar energy

104
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,880
projects and other infrastructure projects in Angola. But

105
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,960
US investments in the region are minimal compared

106
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,005
to what the Chinese government has provided over

107
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:17,245
the past 20 years. Still doesn't measure up

108
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:19,265
to what the Chinese have done across Africa,

109
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:21,245
but it is a start and I think

110
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,190
that African countries are starting to notice that

111
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,390
that's happening. However, the Lobito railway project might

112
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,210
still benefit the Chinese. There's also a reality

113
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,465
that, the Lobito corridor will not exclude the

114
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:36,105
export of minerals to China along it. It's

115
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:39,625
not a monopoly railroad for the United States

116
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,720
and the EU. It's for free trade. And

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
this corridor might just be the start of

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,080
more US investment in Africa. The final blueprint

119
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,245
would be railroads from the Atlantic to the

120
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:54,405
Indian Ocean. And the United States is helping

121
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,670
fund the the research into whether that's feasible.

122
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,210
And who knows? Maybe someday might fund the,

123
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,510
you know, the project itself.
