An ability to control your levels of stress

2
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:15,005
in real time is extremely powerful. It turns

3
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,565
out you can do this using physiology and

4
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:21,460
neuroscience. Your breathing can directly impact your heart

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,200
rate and your level of stress or calm.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,855
Here's how it works. When you inhale, your

7
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:31,455
diaphragm moves down. This creates more space in

8
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:34,175
your thoracic cavity and your heart actually gets

9
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:36,750
a little bit bigger. As a consequence, the

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,910
rate of blood flow through that larger heart

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,510
volume slows down. A signal is sent from

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,315
a group of neurons on your heart called

13
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:47,195
the sinoatrial node. That signal goes up to

14
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:49,595
the brain and your brain sends a signal

15
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:52,175
to speed the heart up. In other words,

16
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:56,090
inhaling speeds your heart rate up. The opposite

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,570
is true as well. When you exhale, your

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,435
diaphragm moves up. Your heart gets a little

19
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:03,275
bit smaller because there's a little bit less

20
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,175
space in your thoracic cavity. As a consequence,

21
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:09,055
blood flows more quickly through that smaller volume.

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,310
The sinoatrial node registers that and sends a

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,630
signal to your brain, and the brain sends

24
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,455
a signal to slow the heart down. So

25
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:19,775
in other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate

26
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:22,815
up, exhaling slows your heart rate down. So

27
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,255
if you want to speed up your heart

28
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:27,640
rate and be more alert, inhale more or

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,640
make those inhales more vigorous, more intense. If

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,755
you want to calm down, you can do

31
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,395
that quickly by making your exhale slightly longer

32
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:39,295
than your inhales, or making them more vigorous.

33
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:41,675
This doesn't require any breath work. This is

34
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,670
something that you can do in real time.

35
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,890
And that's what's called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. That's

36
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,130
the technical phrase. It's also the basis of

37
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,415
what's called heart rate variability or HRV. But

38
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:56,135
all you need to remember is inhaling deeper

39
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:58,315
and longer will speed your heart rate up.

40
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,490
Exhaling longer and more intensely will slow your

41
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,090
heart rate down and will allow you to

42
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,710
calm down in real time.
