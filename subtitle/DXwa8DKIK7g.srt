No. No. No. I don't buy it. What?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,955
You're not a headband. You can't be here.

3
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:11,875
I tried looking you up with nothing. It's

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,715
like you don't even exist. I guess I'm

5
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:18,410
just your fantasy. So what's the biggest difference

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,895
between the real you and your occupation? By

7
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:27,375
the way, my name is Gary Johnson, and

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:33,298
I'm a fake hitman. I realize not everyone

9
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:34,210
fantasized about the same hitman. Every sting operation

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,130
about the same hit man. Every sting operation

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,325
was a performance. This is serious. I am

12
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:45,365
in service business. And each arrest was like

13
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:53,370
a standing ovation. Okay. Daniel Day. I headed

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,650
down to a science. Sounds lovely. Until things

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:12,870
got, well, run, Madison. We're expecting heavy turbulence,

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,805
so prepare to grace for him. Do I

17
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:24,885
scare you? No. Remember the lady came in

18
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,390
trying to have her husband kill that we

19
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,190
let go? No. That he let go. Yeah.

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,510
Her husband was just found dead. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:45,530
What happened? From my perspective, you're getting a

22
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,670
little sloppy. You're Gary? Who the hit man?

23
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,265
My name is Gary Johnson, and my simple

24
00:01:54,265 --> 00:02:00,710
question for you is, who is your hit

25
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,730
man? We'll see. Oh lord.
